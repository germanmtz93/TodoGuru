# TodoGuru CI/CD Pipeline POC

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for the TodoGuru CLI application.

## 🚀 Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple workflows that demonstrate different aspects of modern software development practices:

### 1. **Quick Test Pipeline** (`quick-test.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Fast feedback for developers
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull Requests
- **Stages**:
  - Unit Testing
  - Code Quality (Linting)
  - Package Building

### 2. **Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline** (`ci-cd-pipeline.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Full pipeline demonstration with all stages
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull Requests, Manual dispatch
- **Stages**:
  - Code Quality & Linting
  - Security Scanning
  - Testing (Multi-Python versions)
  - Build & Package
  - Integration Testing
  - Performance Testing
  - Documentation Generation
  - Release Management
  - Notifications

### 3. **Security Scan** (`security-scan.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Dedicated security analysis
- **Triggers**: Weekly schedule, Push to main, Pull Requests
- **Tools**: Bandit, Safety, pip-audit, Dependency Review

### 4. **Deployment Demo** (`deploy-demo.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate deployment practices
- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch with environment selection
- **Environments**: Staging, Production

## 🛠️ Pipeline Features

### Code Quality
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **mypy**: Type checking

### Security
- **Bandit**: Security linting
- **Safety**: Vulnerability scanning
- **pip-audit**: Dependency auditing
- **Dependency Review**: GitHub's dependency analysis

### Testing
- **pytest**: Unit testing
- **Coverage**: Test coverage reporting
- **Multi-Python**: Testing on Python 3.11 and 3.12
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end functionality testing
- **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking

### Build & Deploy
- **Package Building**: Wheel and source distribution
- **Artifact Management**: Upload/download of build artifacts
- **Release Management**: Automated GitHub releases
- **Environment Deployment**: Staging and production

## 📋 How to Use

### 1. Quick Start
The pipeline will automatically run on:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch

### 2. Manual Triggers
You can manually trigger workflows from the GitHub Actions tab:

#### Quick Test
```bash
# This runs automatically, but you can also trigger manually
# Go to Actions > Quick Test Pipeline > Run workflow
```

#### Full Pipeline
```bash
# Go to Actions > TodoGuru CI/CD Pipeline > Run workflow
# This will run all stages including release preparation
```

#### Security Scan
```bash
# Go to Actions > Security Scan > Run workflow
# Runs weekly automatically, but can be triggered manually
```

#### Deployment
```bash
# Go to Actions > Deployment Demo > Run workflow
# Select environment: staging or production
```

### 3. Viewing Results

#### Pipeline Status
- Check the **Actions** tab in GitHub
- Each workflow shows detailed logs and results
- Failed stages are clearly marked

#### Artifacts
- Build packages are available as downloadable artifacts
- Security reports are uploaded for review
- Coverage reports are generated and uploaded

#### Notifications
- Pipeline summary is posted as a step summary
- Release notes are automatically generated
- Status badges can be added to README

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
The pipeline uses GitHub's built-in secrets and variables:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatically provided for repository access
- Environment-specific secrets can be added for deployment

### Python Versions
- Primary: Python 3.11
- Matrix testing: Python 3.11, 3.12

### Dependencies
The pipeline installs dependencies as needed:
```yaml
# Core dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Code quality
pip install flake8 black isort mypy

# Security
pip install bandit safety pip-audit

# Build
pip install build twine
```

## 📊 Pipeline Metrics

### Success Criteria
- All tests pass
- Code coverage meets thresholds
- Security scans show no critical issues
- Linting passes without errors
- Build completes successfully

### Performance Benchmarks
The pipeline includes performance testing:
- Task addition: 1000 tasks
- Task listing: 100 iterations
- Results are logged for monitoring

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Linting Failures
```bash
# Fix formatting
black todo_cli/ tests/

# Fix imports
isort todo_cli/ tests/

# Fix linting issues
flake8 todo_cli/ tests/ --max-line-length=88
```

#### 2. Test Failures
```bash
# Run tests locally
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=todo_cli --cov-report=html
```

#### 3. Build Failures
```bash
# Install build dependencies
pip install build twine

# Build package
python -m build

# Check package
twine check dist/*
```

### Debugging
- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
- Use the "Re-run jobs" feature to retry failed stages
- Download artifacts to inspect generated files

## 🔄 Pipeline Evolution

This POC demonstrates a progression from simple to complex:

1. **Basic Testing** → **Comprehensive Testing**
2. **Single Environment** → **Multi-Environment**
